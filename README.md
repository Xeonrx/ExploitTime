I created this repo as a resource list to aid in the discovery of known vulnerabilites & avaible exploits online<br />
Do not use this guide if you are looking for exploit crafting. We are looking for already published exploits here.

*Note: I reccomend you work and test out exploits inside of a secure virtual environment.*

## Search Engines
Sometimes finding an exploit for the right service is as simple as looking it up. Here are some common search engines in 
which you may find reliable results.

>1 )   https://www.google.com/ <br />
>2 )   https://www.youtube.com/ <br />
>3 )   https://github.com/search

## Databases
There's a database for pratically everything. That considers exploits as well! Have a look at some well known ones.
