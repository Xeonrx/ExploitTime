I created this repo as a resource list to give people a hand in searching for documented vulnerabilites and published exploits on the internet.
I do not own any of these resources, and don't take credit for them. If you would like to contribute, you can reccomend any resources by filling
out an issue on the git repo. Thanks a lot.

*Note: I reccomend you work and test out exploits inside of a secure virtual environment.*

## Search Engines
Sometimes finding an answer is as simple as looking it up.

## Databases
There's a database for pratically everything. That considers vulnerabilites & exploits as well!
