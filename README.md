I created this repo as a resource list to aid in the discovery of known vulnerabilites & avaible exploits online.<br />
Do not use this guide if you are looking for exploit crafting. We are looking for already published exploits here.

*Note: I reccomend you work and test out exploits inside of a secure virtual environment.*

## Search Engines
Sometimes finding an answer is as simple as looking it up.

## News
Staying up with the latest news is good as well. Stay on top of the public information.
